# Changelog

All notable changes to vouchkit are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) (pre-1.0: minor/patch numbers may
carry breaking changes while the API stabilizes).

## [0.0.2] - Unreleased

### Added

- **OpenID4VP verifier-side transport** (`vouchkit.openid4vp`): the relying party's half of
  "sign in with the EU wallet" — nonce/state minting, a DCQL credential-query subset,
  ES256-signed request objects (`typ: oauth-authz-req+jwt`), the `openid4vp://` authorize URL
  (request by value or by `request_uri`), and `response_mode=direct_post` response handling
  with one-time, TTL-bounded transactions. Presentations are verified by the existing core
  (`verify_sd_jwt_vc`); DCQL satisfaction is checked against what was actually disclosed.
- **Backend seam** (`vouchkit.backends`): optional trust-anchor and receipt-sink interfaces,
  each with a local-first default. No backend can alter what is accepted or rejected, and a
  receipt-sink failure never fails or delays verification. Design in `docs/design/backends.md`.
- **`TestWallet`** in the test kit: an in-process wallet stand-in for a full OpenID4VP
  request/response round-trip in CI, no device or network required.
- **Live-interop artifacts** from a manual on-device session against the EUDI reference wallet
  (Android demo build, 2026-07): a runnable demo relying party (`examples/demo_rp.py`),
  wildcard-DCQL and `x509_hash` signed-request support, and a written findings report
  (`docs/interop/eudi-reference-wallet-2026-07.md`). The session validated transport,
  intent delivery, and request-object parsing end to end against a real wallet and a real
  credential; it stopped at the wallet's reader-trust-store check (self-signed verifier cert
  rejected — the eIDAS 2 RP-registration model working as designed). This is a manual
  session, not a CI or automated interop gate.
- **Agent-experience pack**: `PROMPT.md` (paste-in integration prompt for coding agents),
  `llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt` doc maps, and the co-maintainer call (`CO-MAINTAINER.md`).

### Changed

- README status and package docstring now reflect that the OpenID4VP transport ships in this
  release; the DC API front-end and trust-anchor resolution remain the next layers.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **SD-JWT VC verification core** (`vouchkit.verify_sd_jwt_vc`): issuer-signature verification,
  selective-disclosure digest checking, and KB-JWT holder key-binding validation for the
  HAIP-mandatory profile (ES256, `sha-256` disclosures). Failures are precise, typed
  exceptions that name the rule that failed and never carry claim values.
- **Integrator test kit** (`vouchkit.testkit`): `TestIssuer` / `TestHolder` for minting
  known-good and deliberately broken presentations, so integrators can prove their wiring in
  CI without a wallet, trust list, or network. Adversarial tests are the spine of the suite.
